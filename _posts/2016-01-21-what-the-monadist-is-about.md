Welcome to the Monadist and my name is Sunny! 

**Why the name Monadist?**

From the root word 'Monad' which is the historical term for a unicellular organism in Biology, I want to honor the simplest things in life that makes the biggest difference. True in nature, even more so in our lives. 

**What is the Monadist about?**

Giving back. 

When I started doing pet grooming as a profession in 2010, it started more as a way to make amendments on what a terrible job I have done as a dog owner.

What I wasn't prepared for is that as I worked on more and more clients, it seems that most owners had the same problems as I did - confusion from conflicting information, lack of time, behavioral and chronic health problems.

But over the years I'm glad that I have been able to help many pets and their owners find greater balance in their lives. Now I wish the same for you too. 

**What you'll find**

More than just tools and ideas to help you achieve better results in areas of their health, behavior and grooming, I'll also share the proper mindset we should have as care takers as our pets have such a deep emotional connection with us.

What I hope is that through this blog, you too would be able to discover an even more fulfilling relationship with your pet, all of these with less time, less effort and less stress.

**Thank you!**

And do always remember that I'm always here for you as a friend. Feel free to drop me an email at to let me know if you have any feedback or questions for me! It's always a thrill to read email from my readers.

Finally, I'd like to thank you for being here, for showing the interest in improving the lives of your pets. All the best and stay in touch!

Best,  
Sunny
